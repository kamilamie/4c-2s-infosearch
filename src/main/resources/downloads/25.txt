The set of symbols described in this article are known as international flag identification symbols (IFIS), which were devised by Whitney Smith. Contents 1 National flag variants by use 1.1 Combinations 2 Other symbols 3 In Unicode 4 Literature 5 See also 6 References National flag variants by use[edit] Some countries use a single flag design to serve as the national flag in all contexts of use; others use multiple flags that serve as the national flag, depending on context (i.e., who is flying the national flag and where). The six basic contexts of use (and potential variants of a national flag) are: Civil flag – Flown by citizens on land. State flag – Flown on public buildings. War flag – Flown on military buildings. Civil ensign – Flown on private vessels (fishing craft, cruise ships, yachts, etc.). State ensign – Flown on unarmed government vessels. Naval ensign – Flown on warships. In practice, a single design may be associated with multiple such usages; for example, a single design may serve a dual role as war flag and ensign. Even with such combinations, this framework is not complete: some countries define designs for usage contexts not expressible in this scheme such as air force ensigns (distinct from war flags or war ensigns, flown as the national flag at air bases; for example, see Royal Air Force Ensign) and civil air ensigns.
