Indus Gorge - Wikipedia Indus Gorge From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search The gorge formed by the river Indus as it skirts the Himalayas in the west The deepest canyon in the world, the Indus Gorge with Nanga Parbat, the world's 9th highest mountain rising to the south. The Indus Gorge is formed by the Indus river as it skirts the Nanga Parbat massif, the western anchor of the Himalayas, and before it debouches into the plains of Punjab in Pakistan. The gorge is 4,500–5,200 metres (15,000–17,000 feet) deep near the Nanga Parbat. In the Nanga Parbat region, the massive amounts of erosion due to the Indus river following the capture and rerouting through that area is thought to bring middle and lower crustal rocks to the surface.[1] References[edit] ^ Zeitler, Peter K.; Koons, Peter O.; Bishop, Michael P.; Chamberlain, C.
