Vexillology - Wikipedia Vexillology From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Study of the history, symbolism and usage of flags For the Deadmau5 album of the same name, see Vexillology (deadmau5 album). The flag of the International Federation of Vexillological Associations depicts a sheet bend. Vexillology (/ˌvɛksɪˈlɒlədʒi/) is the study of the history, symbolism and usage of flags or, by extension, any interest in flags in general.[1] The word is a synthesis of the Latin word vexillum (which refers to a kind of square flag which was carried by Roman cavalry[2]) and the Greek suffix -logia ("study").[3] The first known usage of the word vexillology was in 1959.[4] A person who studies flags is a vexillologist, one who designs flags is a vexillographer, and the art of flag-designing is called vexillography. One who is a hobbyist or general admirer of flags is a vexillophile. Contents 1 History 2 See also 3 References 4 Further reading 5 External links History[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2018) The study of flags, or vexillology, was formalized by the U.S. scholar and student of flags Whitney Smith in 1961 with the publication of The Flag Bulletin.[5] During his lifetime, Smith organized various flag organizations and meetings including the first International Congress of Vexillology (ICV), the North American Vexillological Association, and the International Federation of Vexillological Associations (FIAV).[6] Smith, who is acknowledged as conceiving the term "vexillology" in 1957, wrote "[w]hile the use of flags goes back to the earliest days of human civilization, the study of that usage in a serious fashion is so recent that the term for it ... did not appear in print until 1959."[7] Before this time, study of flags was generally considered a part of heraldry. Involvement in vexillology includes academic work in fields such as sociology, history or design, professional or otherwise, contributions from the flag industry, and interest from those simply passionate about flags. ICV and local vexillological meetings often cover a wide range of interest in flags. Since 1969, an International Congress of Vexillology has been organized every two years under the auspices of FIAV; papers presented at an ICV are published afterwards as the Congress's Proceedings.[5] See also[edit] Heraldry and Vexillology portal Glossary of vexillology Vexillological symbol Vexillum Vexilloid Flags of the World List of vexillologists Heraldry List of national flags by design Similarities in flags References[edit] ^ Smith, Whitney.
